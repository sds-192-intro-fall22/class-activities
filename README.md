# Class Activities

Every week, I will post our class activities in this GitHub repo. To access this repo on your computer for the first time, you should:

1. Copy the URL above to your Clipboard.
2. Navigate to RStudio.
3. Click File > New Project > Version Control > Git
4. In the window that appears, paste the URL that you copied in the last step into the ‘Repository URL’ box.
5. Where it says ‘Create project as subdirectory of:’, make sure you store this project in the SDS 192 folder.
6. Click ‘Create Project.’
7. Open the corresponding day's .qmd files to complete the lab.

**Note that you should only have to do this once!** 

After this, to access new class activities, you only need to be sure that you have the `class-activities` project open in RStudio. Then you can click the blue downward arrow in the Git tab in your environment to pull the latest activities to your computer. You don't need to submit anything when it comes to class activities, so you only need to save the files. You don't need to (and you won't be able to) stage, commit, and push them.
